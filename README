1. What is it?
--------------

It is a random number generator that produces non-deterministic random numbers
or pseudo-random, if there is no support. To check if there is a support from
device or there is no, just use isDeviceSupport() method for any created object
of random generator. It returns true if there is the support, of course.



2. How to use it?
-----------------

There are two types of random generators which you should use:
RandomIntGenerator and RandomRealGenerator. It is obvious that first produces
random integer numbers while the second produces real numbers.

To create generator to produce integer numbers or real numbers you must specify
the type. For example, we will create one generator to produce integer numbers
of the long type and second to generate real numbers of the float type.

    RandomIntGenerator< long > randomLongsGenerator;
    RandomRealGenerator< float > randomFloatsGenerator;

Now, we can start generate random numbers using created generators.

In the main() function you can find the example code how to use generators
in all possible ways.



3. Getting a single random number.
----------------------------------

There are two ways, we can call for a new random number or just send variable
created before to be random.

Example for random int type numbers within the range < 1; 100 >:


    RandomIntGenerator< int > randomIntsGenerator;

    int number;
    
    // First approach.
    number = randomIntsGenerator.getOne( 1, 100 );
    
    // Second approach.
    randomIntsGenerator.makeOneRandom( number, 1, 100 );


NOTE: You should use these approaches only if you need a single random number
      within the specific range.



4. Getting a single random array.
---------------------------------

There are two ways too. First approach allocates a new array, fills it
with random numbers and returns pointer to it. Second approach doing
the same thing, but does not allocate a new array.

Example for creating a random array with ten elements (range is < 1; 100 >):


    RandomIntGenerator< int > randomIntsGenerator;
    
    // First approach.
    int* newRandomArray = randomIntsGenerator.createOneArray( 10, 1, 100 );
    delete[] newRandomArray;
    
    // Second approach.
    int randomArray[ 10 ];
    randomIntsGenerator.makeOneArrayRandom( randomArray, 10, 1, 100 )


IMPORTANT: You will have to remember about deallocation with delete[]
           in the first approach for your own!
           You will have to be sure, that entered length in the second approach
           is not too large!

NOTE: You should use these approaches only if you need a single random array
      within the specific range.



5. Getting sequences of random numbers within the range defined before.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For instance, we want to get ten thousands of random numbers within
the range < 1; 100 >. There is no need to sending the range all the time.
Moreover, that kind of approach is not so efficient.

Then we use the prepare() method. Example below.


    RandomIntGenerator< int > randomIntsGenerator;
    
    randomIntsGenerator.prepare( 1, 100 );  // We are defining the range.
    
    for ( unsigned i = 0; i < 10,000; ++i ) {
        // Now we only need to use getNext() method.
        std::cout << randomIntsGenerator.getNext() << std::endl;
    }


There are more possibilities after the preparation. You can use:

    getNext()
    createNextArray()
    makeNextRandom()
    makeNextArrayRandom()
    
Each of these methods was described in RandomGenerator.hpp file.
